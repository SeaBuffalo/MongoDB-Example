# MongoDB Example App
Basic MongoDB instance created with Node.js and Docker with sample inserting and listing functions.

## To Begin
Make sure you have Docker installed on your system
[Click here to download from the Docker homepage.](https://www.docker.com/)

Install all relevent dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

Then, run 
```sh
docker run --publish 27017:27017 --name node-mongo --detach mongo:4
```
to create a docker container with a MongoDB instance

## Interacting with your Database
To view the contents of your database, simply run
```sh
node tasks
```
To insert a document to your collection, run
```sh
node tasks "Walk the dog."
```

See if you can create your own custom functionality with your new database!
[Here is a reference to the MongoDB npm package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb)

## When you are finished playing with your Docker instance
Stop your container
```sh
docker stop <ContainerID>
```
and remove it with
```sh
docker rm --force <ContainerID>
```
You can check your current Docker containers and their ID's with the desktop app downloaded from the [Docker Website](https://www.docker.com/), or by running
```sh
docker ps
```
